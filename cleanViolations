/* 
The following code reads NYC restuarant health code ratings (assumed to exist in nyc_inspection_data/WebExtract.txt) and writes out a cleanedData.db SQL database, as well as a zipMeans.csv file with the mean scores of every zipcode (if they have at least 100 ratings).

NYC restaurant ratings can be aquired directly from NYC Dept. of Health & Mental Hygiene throught the following government website:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59/data

After importing from the downloaded Excel file into a "webextract" table, we will create a new, cleaned "recent" table of only the most recent rating for each establishment.
For our purposes, the most important columns are CAMIS (the resturant's unique ID), ZIPCODE, INSPDATE (the datetime-formatted string of the time of inspection), and SCORE.
Finally, the average score per zipcode will be deposited in a "zipMeans" table for writing to a .csv file later. This data will be used in the following plot:
